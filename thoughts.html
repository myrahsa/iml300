		<h3>Hello World Wide Web</h3>
		<p>In <a href="https://medium.com/s/world-wide-wtf/how-to-internet-6c379e75c8e0">“How to Internet</a>,” Odell examines the expansion of the internet over the past couple decades and how this has impacted both our usage and perspective. Though the amount of content available today is endless, she brings up a good point of how the excitement of connecting with others and “surfing” the web are no longer the same. As much as you can connect with others and almost create your own universe, you can also encounter those with entirely different viewpoints. In addition to this, there are more obvious attempts (and successes) in using the medium to reach business goals. </p>

		<p> <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/">Schwulst</a> acknowledges the pressures that come along with making a website, but she uses metaphors to encourage the readers to create their own purpose. She emphasizes that it’s not exactly a finished piece and and changes with us. I think <a href="https://mollysoda.exposed/">Molly Soda’s website</a> is a good representation of these ideas as it displays her work, but its design is intentional and it isn’t just a basic archive. I also enjoyed her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tHXNXaIxg0">house tour video</a> and found it to be humorous by pushing the viewer to consider looking at popular themes across the internet in a different way.</p>

		<p>
			<i>
				<b>Qs:</b> <br>
				Do we have any control over the content we engage with, or is it impractical to attempt to filter out dangerous material? Is connecting with others that have opposing views actually harmful? Is it possible that this could serve as an advantage as well since it exposes us to information we might not see otherwise, widening our worldview?</i>

		<h3>Archive the Internet</h3>
		<p>Paul Soulellis’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/354276810">talk at Eyeo</a> shares the importance of “urgent craft,” which he explains to be a form of publicizing a message in the face of immediate crisis, both in a way that is slow and through delayed urgency. Among many things, urgent craft is a messy and collaborative process, it doesn’t have a narrative, and it provides a space for the less obvious moments in history. Soulellis’s project “Library of the Printed Web” first brought this idea to light by freezing pieces of the web onto paper and creating an in-between place that is both digital and physical. He also mentions quite a few pieces from other artists such as Nicole Killian’s article in queer.archive.work and the project at RISD by Nafis White and Garcia Sinclair. While these aren’t all consistent with one another, they have a shared role of being an agitator and forcing the question of how exactly do we choose what to preserve throughout history? Becoming legible, essentially becoming visible or public, already has levels of privilege on its own.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.ibraaz.org/essays/163/">Lara Baladi’s article</a> delves into this practice of archiving by looking at the 2011 uprisings in Egypt and the 18 days surrounding them. With the revolution, Egyptians were able to use art as a means of activism and document raw footage in digital spaces, using them against the regime. However, this quickly turned into a battle of building a space of resistance and being censored and erased despite how vital this tool was in bringing people together. Baladi also noticed that over half of Egyptians don’t have access to internet, so many people are left out. Through the uproar and periods of restrictions and silence, the function of these platforms were threatened. As the opposition increases, so does the control on expression. Still, whatever the form, remembering these stories alone remains an act of resistance.</p>

		<p>
			<i>
				<b>Qs:</b> <br>
				Is it possible to reconstruct digital archives to prevent some pieces from getting buried or lost? In the same sense, is a messy archive better than one that documents history in a way that follows a narrative? How do we decide what’s significant and what isn’t?</i>

		<h3>Interface</h3>
		<p>American Artist’s <a href="https://unbag.net/end/black-gooey-universe">“Black Gooey Universe”</a> discusses the inception of the graphical user interface and how its history in Silicon Valley is based around whiteness. The article describes the transition from a black screen to a white screen as a metaphor for the erasure of blackness. This process reveals that although this white interface is now universal, the technology still traces its roots back to anti-blackness.</p>
		<p>In <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/RUE/">“Rich User Experience,"</a> UX and Desktopization of War,” Lialina examines the impact and uses of UX design. What was once a way of creating responsive pages now resembles user illusion, removing the gap that comes from interacting with the system. This uninterrupted experience can appear to be more “natural.” The smoothness isn’t necessarily always an advantage though and at some point, it can become dangerous as Lialina points out through the example of war audiovisuals. As a result, UX designers have a responsibility when creating products, but not everyone is fully educated about their role and even the terms have started to lose or shift in meaning. </p>

		<p>
			<i>
				<b>Qs:</b> <br>
				As society’s perception of racial inequality is changing, how would this impact user interface? Does the existence of the undo button truly delete actions unlike reality? Would removing “user illusion” negatively impact accessibility?</i>

		<h3>Surveillance + Identity</h3>
		<p>In her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=666Kq95xm1o">TEDx Talk</a>, Heather Dewey-Hagborg shares her experiment, StrangerVisions, where she extracted DNA through pieces collected from the streets of New York. From trash like chewed gum and cigarette buds, she was able to create portrait sculptures and obtain other personal information about the individuals. The project overall examines the grey area of how much is legal in biological surveillance. <a href="https://vimeo.com/354276402">Lauren McCarthy</a> also discusses surveillance, but she instead focuses on the line between invasion of privacy and the need to be seen and heard as a human being. McCarthy built a few project starting with a “following” service, an intimate smart home experience, and eventually a smart pillow. While focusing on the idea of what it means to feel at home, she made comparisons to popular artificial intelligence services like Amazon’s Alexa. <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/everyone-watches-nobody-sees-how-black-women-disrupt-surveillance-theory">Sydette Harry’s article</a> points out issues around ahistorical surveillance of black women, emphasizing the erasure of their contributions and their struggles. </p>

		<p>
			<i>
				<b>Qs:</b> <br>
				As they are advertised to enhance convenience, do services like Alexa and Google Home inherently encourage over-reliance on technology, minimizing the appearance of their risks? How does this change the idea of “home” and what it means to have a comfortable space? How transparent should social media services be about their surveillance practices, particularly when a user first signs up?</i>

		<h3>Machine Oppression</h3>
		<p>In <a href="https://vimeo.com/233011125">Mimi Onuoha’s Eyeo talk</a>, she discusses the Middletown study from the 1920s and how it, to the public, represents American towns as a whole. She also shared her experiments of giving her phone number to cat callers and collecting data from a few groups of people in London. Through the research, she found that considering the collection process is crucial in order to work with the full data as collection is always contextual. Complicating factors and missing datasets reveal patterns to exclusion. <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/afro-now-ism/">“Afro-now-ism”</a> examines the proliferation of AI and how American ideals oppose power relations as Dinkins points out social inequity. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG_X_7g63rY">Buolamwini’s Ted Talk</a> explores algorithmic bias and her experience with software that could not recognize her face. She emphasizes how these systems were created by people and reflect the norm as established in the training sets.</p>

		<p>
			<i>
				<b>Qs:</b> <br>
				How does the Face ID feature in newer phones display racial bias? Along with the older fingerprint recognition feature, are these simply a matter of convenience, and what risks are there regarding our privacy and surveillance? Moving forward, is it actually possible to entirely remove bias in software if there isn’t full transparency in data collection practices?</i>

		<h3>Data Heal + Digital Decolonization</h3>
		<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/233683682">Morehshin Allahyari’s Eyeo talk</a> discusses digital colonialism and art activism as she shares the process around her 3D printing project, Material Speculation: ISIS. Allahyari urges that we let go of a black and white perspective that separates the West from the rest of the world and adopt an alternative mindset. In <a href="https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/digital-doulas-fixing-data-trauma">Yaa Addae’s article</a>, she talks about data trauma the recent coining of the term data healing. Through data healing, we are asked to examine our methods of engagement through technology and redefine our relationship with it. Olivia Ross’s <a href="https://contributors-zine.p5js.org/#reflection-olivia-mckayla-ross">“How to Write Non-Violent Creative Code”</a> proposes a list that can be used to guide how we approach our digital work, aiming to make it more inclusive with the introduction of reindigenization.</p>

		<p>
			<i>
				<b>Qs:</b> <br>
				How can Ross’s guide be adapted for other modes of creation in the online space? Does data healing conflict with the idea of limiting our time with technology as a form of care? Is it possible to completely remove bias in our current space without having to entirely reconstruct it?</i>
