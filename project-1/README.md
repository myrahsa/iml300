[safe space](https://myrahsa.github.io/iml300/project-1/index.html) is an interactive pixel art based web experience.


### Description

As the digital age evolves, so does the potential for the internet to serve as a method of escapism as it offers comfort in ways often not possible in reality. To mimic this experience, this hypernarrative immerses the user into an 8-bit virtual world, essentially taking them through a computer-based alternate reality free from judgement and external pressures. While the user nagivates, they are able to create a personalized journey between different pixel locations. Overall, the narrative allows the user to explore their relationship with virtual and physical spaces, encouraging a healthy balance between both and the acknowledgement of the web's advantages and limitations.
